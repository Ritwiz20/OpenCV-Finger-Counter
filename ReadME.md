# Hand Gesture Detection using OpenCV and CVZone

### Introduction
This is a Python program that uses OpenCV and the CVZone library to detect hand gestures in real-time video streams from a camera. The program captures the video using the default camera and displays it on the screen. It then uses the CVZone HandDetector module to detect hands in the video stream and track the movement of the fingers to determine how many fingers are raised.

### Requirements
This program requires the following libraries:

- OpenCV
- CVZone

### Usage - 
To install the required modules, you can use pip by running the following command:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Execute 

To run the script, simply navigate to the directory where the script is saved and run the following command:

python filename.py


While the script is running, you will see a window displaying the video captured from the camera. The script will exit if you press the ESC key.
